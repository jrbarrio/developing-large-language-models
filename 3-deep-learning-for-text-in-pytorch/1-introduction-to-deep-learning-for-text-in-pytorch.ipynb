decease,\\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\\nFeed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,\\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\\nThou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,\\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\\nAnd, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:\\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\\n  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.', 'When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,\\nThy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,\\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held:\\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.', 'How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,\\nIf thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine\\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’\\nProving his beauty by succession thine.', 'This were to be new made when thou art old,\\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.', 'Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,\\nNow is the time that face should form another,\\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.', 'For where is she so fair whose uneared womb\\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?', 'Or who is he so fond will be the tomb\\nOf his self-love to stop posterity?', 'Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee\\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime,\\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.', 'But if thou live remembered not to be,\\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.', 'Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,\\nUpon thyself thy beauty’s legacy?', 'Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\\nThen beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,\\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?', 'Profitless usurer why dost thou use\\nSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?', 'For having traffic with thyself alone,\\nThou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,\\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?', 'Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\\n  Which used lives th’ executor to be.', 'Those hours that with gentle work did frame\\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\\nWill play the tyrants to the very same,\\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\\nBeauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:\\nThen were not summer’s distillation left\\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\\nBeauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,\\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.', 'But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\\n  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.', 'Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,\\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:\\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,\\nWith beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:\\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\\nThat’s for thyself to breed another thee,\\nOr ten times happier be it ten for one,\\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art,\\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\\nLeaving thee living in posterity?', 'Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,\\n  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.', 'Lo in the orient when the gracious light\\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\\nServing with looks his sacred majesty,\\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car,\\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\\nThe eyes (fore duteous) now converted are\\nFrom his low tract and look another way:\\n  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:\\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.', 'Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?', 'Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\\nWhy lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,\\nOr else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?', 'If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\nBy unions married do offend thine ear,\\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:\\nMark how one string sweet husband to another,\\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\\nResembling sire, and child, and happy mother,\\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\\n  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.', 'Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,\\nThat thou consum’st thyself in single life?', 'Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife,\\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep,\\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\\nBy children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:\\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\nBut beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,\\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it:\\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\\n  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.', 'For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any\\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.', 'Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\\nBut that thou none lov’st is most evident:\\nFor thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,\\nThat ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,\\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:\\nO change thy thought, that I may change my mind,\\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?', 'Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,\\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,\\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.', 'As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,\\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest,\\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,\\nThou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,\\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,\\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay,\\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\\nAnd threescore year would make the world away:\\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\\nLook whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.', 'When I do count the clock that tells the time,\\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\\nAnd sable curls all silvered o’er with white:\\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd\\nAnd summer’s green all girded up in sheaves\\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:\\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,\\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow,\\n  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence\\n  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.', 'O that you were your self, but love you are\\nNo longer yours, than you yourself here live,\\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.', 'So should that beauty which you hold in lease\\nFind no determination, then you were\\nYourself again after yourself’s decease,\\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.', 'Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter’s day\\nAnd barren rage of death’s eternal cold?', 'O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,\\n  You had a father, let your son say so.', 'Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,\\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\\nBut not to tell of good, or evil luck,\\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,\\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;\\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.', 'But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert:\\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,\\n  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.', 'When I consider everything that grows\\nHolds in perfection but a little moment.', 'That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment.', 'When I perceive that men as plants increase,\\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky:\\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory.', 'Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,\\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with Decay\\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.', 'But wherefore do not you a mightier way\\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time?', 'And fortify yourself in your decay\\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?', 'Now stand you on the top of happy hours,\\nAnd many maiden gardens yet unset,\\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\\nWhich this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen\\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\\nCan make you live yourself in eyes of men.', 'To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\\n  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.', 'Who will believe my verse in time to come\\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?', 'Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts:\\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\nThe age to come would say this poet lies,\\nSuch heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.', 'So should my papers (yellowed with their age)\\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,\\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.', 'But were some child of yours alive that time,\\n  You should live twice,—in it, and in my rhyme.', 'Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?', 'Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:\\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed,\\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:\\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,\\nNor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,\\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,\\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.', 'Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,\\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood,\\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,\\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,\\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,\\nAnd do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time\\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets:\\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime,\\nO carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,\\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,\\nHim in thy course untainted do allow,\\nFor beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.', 'Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,\\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.', 'A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,\\nHast thou the master mistress of my passion,\\nA woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted\\nWith shifting change as is false women’s fashion,\\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:\\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth,\\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\\nWhich steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.', 'And for a woman wert thou first created,\\nTill nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.', 'But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,\\n  Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.', 'So is it not with me as with that muse,\\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\\nWho heaven it self for ornament doth use,\\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:\\nWith April’s first-born flowers and all things rare,\\nThat heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.', 'O let me true in love but truly write,\\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair,\\nAs any mother’s child, though not so bright\\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:\\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,\\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.', 'My glass shall not persuade me I am old,\\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\\nBut when in thee time’s furrows I behold,\\nThen look I death my days should expiate.', 'For all that beauty that doth cover thee,\\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,\\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?', 'O therefore love be of thyself so wary,\\nAs I not for my self, but for thee will,\\nBearing thy heart which I will keep so chary\\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.', 'Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\\n  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.', 'As an unperfect actor on the stage,\\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\nWhose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;\\nSo I for fear of trust, forget to say,\\nThe perfect ceremony of love’s rite,\\nAnd in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,\\nO’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might:\\nO let my looks be then the eloquence,\\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.', 'O learn to read what silent love hath writ,\\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.', 'Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,\\nThy beauty’s form in table of my heart,\\nMy body is the frame wherein ’tis held,\\nAnd perspective it is best painter’s art.', 'For through the painter must you see his skill,\\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\\nWhich in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,\\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:\\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,\\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.', 'Let those who are in favour with their stars,\\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\\nWhilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars\\nUnlooked for joy in that I honour most;\\nGreat princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,\\nBut as the marigold at the sun’s eye,\\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.', 'The painful warrior famoused for fight,\\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\\n  Then happy I that love and am beloved\\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.', 'Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage\\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit;\\nTo thee I send this written embassage\\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit.', 'Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine\\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;\\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\\nIn thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:\\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving,\\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect,\\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,\\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.', 'Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tired,\\nBut then begins a journey in my head\\nTo work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.', 'For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see.', 'Save that my soul’s imaginary sight\\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\\nWhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)\\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.', 'Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,\\n  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.', 'How can I then return in happy plight\\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest?', 'When day’s oppression is not eased by night,\\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed.', 'And each (though enemies to either’s reign)\\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.', 'I tell the day to please him thou art bright,\\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\\nSo flatter I the swart-complexioned night,\\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.', 'But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\\n  And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger\\n\\n\\n                    29\\n\\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,\\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\nAnd look upon my self and curse my fate,\\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\\nDesiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,\\nWith what I most enjoy contented least,\\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,\\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,\\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.', 'When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:\\nThen can I drown an eye (unused to flow)\\nFor precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,\\nAnd weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe,\\nAnd moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight.', 'Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,\\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o’er\\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.', 'But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)\\n  All losses are
